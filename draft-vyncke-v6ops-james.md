# Introduction

In 2016, {{?RFC7872}} has measured the drop of packets with IPv6 extension headers on their transit over the global Internet. This document presents a slightly different methodology with more recent results. Since then, {{?I-D.draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering}} has provided some recommendations for filtering transit traffic, there may be some changes in providers policies.

It is still work in progress, but the authors wanted to present some results at IETF-113 (March 2022).

# Methodology

In a first phase, the measurement is done between collaborating IPv6 nodes, a.k.a. vantage points, spread over the Internet and multiple Autonomous Systems (ASs). As seen in {{analysed_as}}, the source/destination/transit ASs include some "tier-1" providers per {{TIER1}}, so, they are probably representative of the global Internet core.

Relying on collaborating nodes has some benefits:

- propagation can be measured even in the absence of any ICMP message or reply generated by the destination;

- traffic timing can be measured accurately to answer whether extension headers are slower than plain IP6 packets;

- traffic can be captured into .pcap {{?I-D.draft-ietf-opsawg-pcap}} file at the source and at the destination for later analysis.

Future phases will send probes to non-collaborating nodes with a much reduced probing speed. The destination will include {{ALEXA}} top-n websites, popular CDN, as well as random prefix from the IPv6 global routing table. A revision of this IETF draft will describe those experiments.

# Measurements

## Vantage Points

Several servers were used worldwide (albeit missing Africa and China as authors were unable to find IPv6 servers in these regions). {{table_vantage}} lists all the vantage points together with their AS number and country.

{::include ./vantage_as.inc}
{: #table_vantage title="All vantage AS"}

### Tested Autonomous Systems {#analysed_as}

During first phase (traffic among fully meshed collaborative nodes), our probes have collected data on the following ASs:

{::include ./analysed_as.inc}
{: #table_analysed_as title="All AS (source/destination/transit)"}

While this document lists some operators, the intent if not to build a wall of fame or a wall of shame but more to get a idea about which kind of providers drop packets with extension headers and how widespread the drop policy is enforced.

### Tested Extension Headers {#tested_eh}

In the first phase among collaborating vantage points, packets always contained either a UDP payload or a TCP payload, the latter is sent with only the SYN flag set and with data as permitted by section 3.4 of {{!RFC793}} (2nd paragraph). A usual traceroute is done with only the UDP/TCP payload without any extension header with varying hop-limit in order to learn the traversed routers and ASs. Then, several UDP/TCP probes are sent by with a set of extension headers:

- destination options header containing either an unknown option with the "skip" bits or an unknown option with the "discard" bits of varying extension header length: 8, 256, and 512 octets;

- hop-by-hop options header containing either an unknown option with the "skip" bits or an unknown option with the "discard" bits of varying extension header length: 8, 256, and 512 octets;

- routing header with routing types from 0 to 6 inclusive (except for type 3);

- atomic fragment header (i.e., M-flag = 0 and offset = 0) or varying frame length 512, 1280, and 1500 octets;

- non-atomic first fragment header (i.e., M-flag = 1 and offset = 0) or varying frame length 512, 1280, and 1500 octets;

- authentication header with dummy SPI followed by UDP/TCP header and a 38 octets payload.

In the above, length is the length of the extension header itself except for the fragmentation header where the length is the frame length (i.e., including the Ethernet, IPv6, and TCP/UDP headers + payload).

For hop-by-hop and destination options headers, when required multiple PadN options were used in order to bypass some Linux kernels that consider a PadN larger than 8 bytes is an attack, see section 5.3 of {{?BCP220}}, even if multiple PadN options violates section 2.1.9.5 of {{?RFC4942}}.

Next phases will also include packets without UDP/TCP but with Next-Header being:

- 59, "no next header" see section 4.7 of {{!RFC8200}};

- 143, "ethernet" see section 4.9 of {{!RFC8986}}.

### Drop attribution to AS

Comparing the traceroutes without extension headers and with extension headers allow the attribution of a packet drop to one AS. But, this is not an easy task as inter-AS links often use IPv6 address of only one AS (if not using link-local per {{?RFC7704}}). This document uses the following algorithm to attribute the drop to one AS for packet sourced in one AS and then having a path traversing AS#foo just before AS#bar:

- if the packet drop happens at the first router (i.e., hop limit == 1 does not trigger an ICMP hop-limit exceeded), then the drop is assumed to this AS as it is probably an ingress filter on the first router (i.e., the hosting provider in most of the cases - except if colocated with an IXP).

- if the packet drop happens in AS#foo after one or more hop(s) in AS#bar, then the drop is assumed to be in AS#foo ingress filter on a router with an interface address in AS#foo

- if the packet drop happens in AS#bar after one or more hop(s) in AS#bar before going to AS#foo, then the drop is assumed to be in AS#foo ingress filter on a router with an interface address in AS#bar

In several cases, the above algorithm was not possible (e.g., some intermediate routers do not generate an ICMP unreachable hop limit exceeded even in the absence of any extension headers), then the drop is not attributed. Please also note that the goal of this document is not to 'point fingers to operators' but more to evaluate the potential impact. I.e., a tier-1 provider dropping packets with extension headers has a much bigger impact on the Internet traffic than an access provider.

## Results

This section presents the current results out of phase 1 (collaborating vantage points) testing. About 4860 experiments were run, one experiment being defined by sending packets between 2 vantage points with hop-limit varying from 1 to the number of hops between the two vantage points and for all the extension headers described in {{tested_eh}}.

### Routing Header

The following table lists all routing header type and the percentage of experiments that were successful, i.e., packets with routing header reaching their destination:

|Routing Header Type|%-age of experiments reaching destination|
| 0 | 80.9% |
| 1 | 99.5% |
| 2 | 99.5% |
| 3 | not tested |
| 4 | 69.0% |
| 5 | 99.5% |
| 6 | 99.3% |

The table below lists the few ASs that drop packets with the routing header type 0 (the original source routing header, which is now deprecated).

{::include ./drop_rh0_as.inc}

It is possibly due to a strict implementation of {{?RFC5095}} but it is expected that no packet with routing header type 0 would be transmitted anymore. So, this is not surprising.

The table below lists the few ASs that drop packets with the routing header type 4 (Segment Routing Header {{?RFC8754}}).

{::include ./drop_rh4_as.inc}

This drop of SRH was to be expected as SRv6 is specified to run only in a limited domain.

Other routing header types (1 == deprecated NIMROD {{?RFC1753}}, 2 == mobile IPv6 {{?RFC6275}},  and even 5 == CRH-16 and 6 == CRH-32{{?I-D.draft-bonica-6man-comp-rtg-hdr}}) can be transmitted over the global Internet without being dropped (assuming that the 0.5% of dropped packets are within the measurement error).

### Hop-by-Hop Options Headers

Many ASs drop packets containing either hop-by-hop options headers per table below:

| Option Type | Length |  %-age of experiments reaching destination |
| Skip | 8 | 5.8% |
| Discard | 8 | 0.0% |
| Skip one large PadN | 256 | 1.9% |
| Skip multiple PadN| 256 | 0.0% |
| Discard | 256 | 0.0% |
| Skip | 512 | 1.9% |
| Discard | 512 | 0.0% |

It appears that hop-by-hop options headers cannot reliably traverse the global Internet only small headers with 'skippable' options have some chances. If the hop-by-hop options has the 'discard' bits, it is dropped per specification.

### Destination Options Headers

Many ASs drop packets containing destination options headers per table below:

| Length | Multiple PadN |  %-age of experiments reaching destination |
| 8 | No | 99.2%|
| 256 | No | 2.6% |
| 256 | Yes | 2.6% |
| 512 | No | 2.6% |

The measurement did not find any impact of the discard/skip bits in the destination headers options, probably because the routers do not look inside the extension headers into the options. The use of a single large PadN or multiple 8-octet PadN options does not influence the result.

### Fragmentation Header

The propagation of two kinds of fragmentation headers was analysed: atomic fragment (offset == 0 and M-flag == 0) and plain first fragment (offset == 0 and M-flag == 1). The table below displays the propagation differences.

| M-flag | %-age of experiments reaching destination |
| 0 (atomic) | 70.2% |
| 1 | 99.0%|

The size of the overall IP packets (512, 1280, and 1500 octets) does not have any impact on the propagation.

### No drop at all

Finally, some ASs do not drop transit traffic (except for routing header type 0) and follow the recommendations of {{?I-D.draft-ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering}}. This list includes tier-1 transit providers (using the "regional" tag per {{TIER1}}):

{::include ./no_drop.inc}

## Summary of the collaborating parties measurements

While the analysis has areas of improvement (geographical distribution and impact on latency), it appears that:

- authentication and non-atomic fragmentation headers can traverse the Internet;

- only routing header types 0 and 4 experiment problems over the Internet, other types have no problems;

- hop-by-hop options header does not traverse the Internet;

- destination options header is not reliable enough especially large size ones.

Of course, the next phase of measurement with non-collaborating parties will probably give another view.

# Security Considerations

While active probing of the Internet may be considered as an attack, this measurement was done among collaborating parties and using the probe attribution technique described in {{?I-D.draft-vyncke-opsec-probe-attribution}}.
